## 🛠️ How Can You Help?

Here are some areas where you can make an immediate impact:

1. **Asset Converters (`crates/converter`)**
   - `.nif` parser improvements and glTF 2.0 export optimization (`mesh-tools`).
   - `.dds` to KTX2 / Basis Universal texture compression pipeline (`ddsfile`, `basis-universal`).
   - `.esm` binary parsing into libSQL / SQLite database structures (`nom`, `rkyv`).
   - Papyrus (`.pex`) decompilation and transpilation to Luau (`mlua`).

2. **Engine Subsystems (`crates/engine`)**
   - Bevy 0.19+ rendering features (Vercidium instancing, HZB occlusion culling, custom mesh pipelines).
   - Physics integration (rigid bodies, collision meshes, character controllers).
   - Audio spatialization and music state machines.

3. **Launcher & UI (`crates/launcher`)**
   - Bevy UI setup wizard and path detection.
   - Built-in mod manager & load order drag-and-drop workflow.

4. **Documentation & Benchmarks**
   - Refining specs in the [`docs/specs/`](docs/specs/) directory.
   - Writing usage guides, benchmark tests, or API documentation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
* **Rust** (2024 Edition)
* **Git**
* **CMake** & **Ninja** / **GCC** (required for compiling native `libSQL` / `sqlite3` dependencies)

### 2. Fork and Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenSkyrim.git
cd OpenSkyrim
```

### 3. Check Workspace Compilation
```bash
cargo check --workspace
```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Find or Create an Issue:**
   Check the issue tracker to ensure no one else is working on the same feature or bug fix.
2. **Create a Feature Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/nif-skinning-support
   ```
3. **Write Clean, Idiomatic Code:**
   Ensure all functions have doc comments (`///`) and pass clippy checks.
4. **Run Formatters & Linters:**
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
   ```
5. **Submit a Pull Request:**
   - Target the `main` branch.
   - Provide a concise description of your changes, referencing any relevant planning docs in `docs/specs/`.
