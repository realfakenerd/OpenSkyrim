# P0 installed corpus observation

The standard-library tool in [`scripts/schema/corpus_manifest.py`](../../../scripts/schema/corpus_manifest.py) records a versioned JSON manifest outside the game install. Its source digests and TES4 observations come from the same verified file descriptor. Runtime mismatch, missing required input, malformed TES4 metadata, duplicate plugin names, unresolved masters, or detected source drift prevents a successful pin.

The read checks file identity, size, modification time and change time before and after hashing. It is not an immutable snapshot: concurrent same-size rewrites can retain both timestamps on this host. Discovery skips symlink directories it observes, and the reader rejects final-component symlinks, but ancestor directories are not pinned. A parent-directory symlink swap after discovery can route the read outside Data under its original Data-relative path without a detected symlink issue. Each hash identifies the bytes read from the opened file; the recorded path does not prove unchanged ancestry. This residual limitation is reported under `unresolved`, not as evidence that a swap occurred in a particular run. Immutable source retention remains separate P1 work.

The 2026-10-04 author-run observation targeted Steam Skyrim SE/AE `1.7.104.0`, build `24914197`, from the local-only install path `/home/dev/skyrim/Skyrim Special Edition`. `SkyrimSE.exe` matched the target SHA-256 `846efccf0c1374d71f892907f46549560f2fcb0a75cb87a3eed438baa0f1402f` and expected size `37,910,440` bytes.

The Data scan found 80 plugin files. All 80 had a bounded TES4 header that decoded, the dependency closure had no missing or ambiguous masters, and all five required base masters were present. The ordered `Skyrim.ccc` list had 75 names, all matching Data plugin filenames. That list is recorded as a declared content list; it does not establish active load order, official status, or entitlement.

No loose `.strings`, `.dlstrings`, or `.ilstrings` files were present. The tool observed 93 BSA/BA2 filenames and sizes without hashing archive contents. Bundled string tables, active load order, and locale therefore remain unresolved. Plugin and loose-table hashes are first observations; no prior accepted corpus digest set was supplied. These gaps block `complete` and `successful_pin` even when the runtime pin and observed file metadata validate.

The full output was saved to the author-host local-only path `/tmp/mudcrab-schema-p0-corpus.json` (297,635 bytes; SHA-256 `dce890a64ac05cd6065275e6c9055589c2ffcdf61b02a99289f3fd8cefc16042`). It contains source names, paths, file hashes/sizes, and TES4 metadata; proprietary file bytes and localization/record dumps remain outside the repository. This observation closes only the installed-file-manifest tooling slice. The broader P0 catalog, validator, archive/localization, and baseline gates remain open.

The recorded invocation uses explicit local-only game paths. Replace them with the actual installation and an output path available on the host running a new scan:

```sh
python3 scripts/schema/corpus_manifest.py \
  --game-root '/home/dev/skyrim/Skyrim Special Edition' \
  --data-dir '/home/dev/skyrim/Skyrim Special Edition/Data' \
  --executable '/home/dev/skyrim/Skyrim Special Edition/SkyrimSE.exe' \
  --output /tmp/mudcrab-schema-p0-corpus.json
```
