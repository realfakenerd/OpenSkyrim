# Reference enable-state evidence for #165

Date: 2026-10-05. This note records the documentary rule and its limits before spawn filtering. It does not claim retail runtime parity.

## Skyrim Creation Kit rule

The Skyrim Creation Kit [Reference page, revision 24591](https://ck.uesp.net/w/index.php?title=Reference&oldid=24591#Enable_Parent), updated 2026-03-28, describes an enable parent as the authority for a child reference's state. It says:

> Their disable/enable state is always determined by their enable parent.

The same section says the child follows the parent's enabled state, or follows its inverse when “Set Enable State to Opposite of Parent” is checked. This means a child's `Initially Disabled` header bit (`0x800`) does not override an existing enable parent. That conclusion follows from the Creation Kit documentation; it is not a measurement of Skyrim's runtime.

## FormID `0x14` and the new-game assumption

The merged [PR #136](https://github.com/Mudcrab-Team/mudcrab/pull/136), checked live on 2026-10-05 at merge commit `2c11897b24f99632dd1072d3bf632341f7667ee4`, reports a read-only check over 80 official plugins. Its database check reports 42,395 resolved XESP parents and 16 remaining parents pointing at `00000014`, the hardcoded player reference absent from plugin records. This is the author's converter/database validation report, not an independent corpus check or runtime observation.

The Skyrim Creation Kit [GetPlayer page, revision 25272](https://ck.uesp.net/w/index.php?title=GetPlayer_-_Game&oldid=25272) defines the return value as “The Actor that represents the player.” Its Notes identify the auto-filled `PlayerRef` property as hardcoded `ACHR:00000014`. The pinned API response is `https://ck.uesp.net/w/api.php?action=query&prop=revisions&revids=25272&rvprop=ids%7Ctimestamp%7Ccontent&rvslots=main&format=json` (page ID `3702`, revision `25272`, timestamp `2026-09-06T01:02:44Z`); its UTF-8 wikitext SHA-256 is `e34dd850ab7a01de137da5c889667c56d582fab0f959b440bb3abafe551180b2`.

These sources establish the identity and role of `0x14`, but do not state that it is always enabled in a clean new game. Treating PlayerRef as enabled for a new-game static snapshot is an explicit implementation assumption based on the player's required role, not a source-verified engine fact. A clean-save runtime check is still needed before claiming retail parity.

## XESP bytes and deleted references

The pinned [TES5Edit Skyrim definitions](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit/blob/9fb016884bec138ea6c7b872cec831537d464c3e/Core/wbDefinitionsTES5.pas#L3075-L3082) define XESP as a parent FormID, a one-byte flags field, and three unused bytes. The flags are ordered as `Set Enable State to Opposite of Parent` (bit 0) and `Pop In` (bit 1).

Mudcrab's [exporter](https://github.com/Mudcrab-Team/mudcrab/blob/2c11897b24f99632dd1072d3bf632341f7667ee4/crates/converter/src/esm/exporter.rs#L698-L706) reads bytes 4–7 of XESP into a full little-endian `u32`. That stored word includes the named flags byte and the three unused bytes. Spawn-state evaluation inspects bit 0 only; pop-in and the upper 24 bits do not change the initial enabled result.

The converter recognizes deleted records by [header bit `0x20`](https://github.com/Mudcrab-Team/mudcrab/blob/2c11897b24f99632dd1072d3bf632341f7667ee4/crates/converter/src/esm/records/mod.rs#L19-L21) and [removes deleted winning FormIDs during plugin merge](https://github.com/Mudcrab-Team/mudcrab/blob/2c11897b24f99632dd1072d3bf632341f7667ee4/crates/converter/src/esm/mod.rs#L122-L125). Deleted winning references therefore do not reach the final reference export. PR #136 also reports that invalid optional parent links are normalized to parent ID zero; zero is the no-parent case, while the original flags are preserved.

## Unresolved cases and evidence boundary

The Creation Kit documentation and the cited converter report do not establish Skyrim's initial behavior for a nonzero parent missing from the effective database, a deleted parent, or an XESP cycle. Their state policy remains unresolved as a question of Skyrim parity. Mudcrab may omit such references and report them as a conservative policy, but that would be an implementation choice rather than documented game behavior. The same applies to any fallback for malformed XESP metadata.

No Skyrim game process or clean-save observation was available during this review. The source-backed rule is parent inheritance with optional bit-0 inversion; dynamic save state, scripts, missing/cyclic links, and the `0x14` initial enabled state remain outside the evidence.

## Implemented bootstrap contract

The database worker resolves initial state by global reference FormID, including parents outside the loaded cell and parents with no model. It memoizes resolved and unresolved chains without recursion. A null/zero parent uses the reference's own `0x800` flag; a nonzero parent supplies the state, with only bit 0 inverting it. PlayerRef `0x14` is preseeded as enabled under the new-game assumption described above. Other missing nonzero parents and cycles remain unresolved under inversion, receive a diagnostic, and do not spawn. Invalid column sets or malformed numeric/flag metadata fail the cell request. Legacy databases without any of the three columns remain readable, default enabled, and warn that reconversion is needed for filtering.

The filter retains rows in `references` and in each loaded cell payload. The common exterior/interior spawn path skips disabled or unresolved rows before any entity, light, model, or collider work for those references. Profiling counts actual spawned references separately from suppressed references. This is an initial-state snapshot; quest/script/save changes and revival of an omitted resident placement are not implemented. The converter currently omits normalized rows for six additional placed types, so parents represented only in `records.data` remain unresolved.

Existing packs from before the parent-link fixes need reconversion. A schema number or the presence of the three columns alone does not certify that the stored XESP FormIDs were remapped correctly.

An object LOD compiler must still exclude enable-dependent references from unconditional merged geometry, including references initially enabled by an enable parent. This filter does not certify that a placement will remain enabled.

## Local verification

Checks used Rust 1.98.1, kache 0.26.3, and the project Nix libraries. Generated test files used a task-owned tmpfs directory. The converted-content fixture loads the child cell before the parent cell to exercise uncached global parent lookup.

- `cargo test --frozen -p engine --lib`: 338 passed.
- `cargo test --frozen -p engine --test reference_enable_state`: 1 passed.
- `cargo clippy --frozen -p engine --all-targets -- -D warnings`: passed.
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `git diff --check`: passed.

These checks cover the initial-state implementation; they do not establish retail runtime parity.
