# L1 material and color pipeline

Tracks [L1 #131](https://github.com/Mudcrab-Team/mudcrab/issues/131), under [vanilla lighting parity #129](https://github.com/Mudcrab-Team/mudcrab/issues/129). L0 reference capture and L1 implementation can proceed concurrently. L0 evidence gates retail parity acceptance, not synthetic tests or implementation.

## Scope and evidence

Default target: unmodded Skyrim SE. Interior and exterior cases have equal priority. Mod research informs native behavior; addon lighting remains out of scope. L1 fixes output-domain inconsistencies and NIF surface inputs, with controlled probes. They do not establish Skyrim's image-space equations or select its final exposure/tone curve.

Code baseline: `a9f2310ccfc691eebb97fde18df1e8d334b7d744`; Bevy 0.19. The source trace below describes actual runtime behavior. Claims in older sky notes about encoded weather interpolation and fog equations still require the L0/L2 retail evidence; this change preserves those inputs.

## Pipeline trace and ownership

| Stage / owner | Input → output | Current limit / next owner |
|---|---|---|
| `converter/src/texture.rs`, `material.rs` | DDS channels → semantic KTX2 transfer format; diffuse/glow use sRGB aliases, normals/data use linear views | Shared source bytes may have distinct views; preserve alpha as data. Existing round-trip tests cover encoded channels. |
| `converter/src/material.rs` | Validated per-shape NIF values → glTF factors, extensions, source extras | #81: specular enable, normal-alpha mask and gloss exponent approximation. #82: static glow-slot eligibility and emission energy corrected; animated emission remains unsupported. #83: alpha/UV. #84: effect/editor surfaces. Remaining issues stay open; emission animation is outside #82. |
| Bevy glTF / `StandardMaterial` | sRGB textures decoded once; material factors and data textures remain linear → material response | Bevy's PBR BRDF is an approximation, not recovered Skyrim shading. Tangent/model-space normals require distinct treatment. |
| `shaders/terrain.wgsl` | Linear layer samples and normal data → weighted material response → PBR lighting | Authored normal conventions, layer semantics and specular response remain separate material probes. |
| Bevy `pbr_functions.wgsl` | Lights + material → exposure-scaled linear RGB | `Exposure.ev100` uses Bevy's `2^-EV100 / 1.2`. Current 9.7 is pinned from the prior default, not a Skyrim value. Emission's exposure weight is material-owned; default emission is exposure-independent. |
| `sky.rs`, `shaders/sky.wgsl` | Encoded weather-row mixing → one sRGB decode → linear palette brightness | Existing palette is a fixed clear-day approximation. Sky/fog palette values already occupy the composition domain; do not multiply them by camera exposure a second time. L2 owns authored state and its units. |
| `DistanceFog` | Exposed surface RGB + linear fog palette → fogged linear RGB | Existing exponential/Fog Far approximation stays explicit. Interior fog removal is current behavior, not complete Skyrim interior semantics. L2 owns the correction. |
| `render.rs` reflection camera | Scene at main-view exposure → `Rgba16Float`, tone mapping disabled | Floating linear target preserves values above 1. Reflection gate copies exposure even while inactive. Existing reflected layers and geometry selection remain unchanged. |
| `shaders/water.wgsl` | Exposed water lighting + exposed linear reflection → blend → surface fog | Reflection receives neither a second lighting evaluation nor a display transform. Existing Fresnel/waves and reflection coverage are approximations. |
| `color_pipeline.rs` / scene cameras | HDR composition → one full-view `TonyMcMapface` transform → display encoding | Includes sky, background, fog, opaque and transparent surfaces. Tone curve remains a pinned diagnostic baseline pending IMGS evidence; L4 owns adaptation/record-driven image-space behavior. |

The previous non-HDR mesh path tone-mapped in each material shader. The custom sky shader bypassed that operation, and reflection RGB passed through tone mapping in both the reflection and water passes. HDR composition moves the transform after composition without adding a new shader implementation. It changes images and consumes more render-target memory; target-hardware performance remains an acceptance requirement.

## Invariants

- V1: Every production scene camera and existing visual fixture uses explicit `SceneColorPipeline`: HDR, EV100 9.7, TonyMcMapface. These values remain provisional; defaults are not evidence of vanilla parity.
- V2: Reflection storage preserves linear values above 1; no tone map or sRGB target view before water sampling. Reflection exposure matches the main camera before rendering, including after exposure changes while water is invisible. Missing reflection exposure ! restore before rendering; pose/visibility updates continue.
- V3: Sky, unlit mesh, fully fogged mesh, terrain emission and unit-reflecting water given equal composition-domain RGB produce matching output within 2/255 per channel. Exterior includes sky; interior has a black background. Test neutral gray and saturated HDR inputs.
- V4: Diagnostic inputs, camera and output settings, samples and verdict are recorded. Probe failure returns a nonzero status; stale reports are removed at startup. Synthetic consistency is not retail parity.
- V5: Preserve NIF source values and declared unsupported families. Do not compensate for pending material errors with global tint, exposure, ambient or emission changes.
- V6: Static emission → authored linear tint × multiplier × eligible glow sample; preserve zero, dim, HDR and black tint. Slot 2 glow ! Glow shader or Glow_Map; Own_Emit alone ≠ texture eligibility. Non-finite source emission or overflowing energy → contextual conversion error before clamping.
- V7: Converter schema 17 → rebuild GLBs from schemas 12–16; reuse verified unchanged texture/script/archive outputs only with matching source/configuration. Historical emission output retained its producer 17 identity; current compatibility is recorded in V11.

- V8: Finite signed NIF tint & static lighting multiplier ! convertible; glTF nonnegative projection retains raw signed color/multiplier and names lower-clamp approximation. Positive channel energy follows V6; signed shader parity remains gap.

- V9: NIF glossiness exponent → bounded monotonic `(2 / (n + 2))^0.25` perceptual roughness; GGX lobe approximation, not exact Skyrim BRDF.
- V10: Specular flag off or strength zero → explicit zero glTF factor. Enabled tangent normals → shared linear normal-alpha mask; model-space normals excluded. glTF specular factor ∈ [0,1]; only tagged loaded masks receive Bevy 0.19 compensation; generic glTF unchanged. F0 still squares scalar/mask inputs; native Skyrim intensity/BRDF parity remains gap.
- V11: Pruning/remapping ! both specular extension textures; removed mask → unchanged bounded factor and no native compensation. Current producer 25 combines native BC textures, emission/specular and source-surface fixes. Rebuild all legacy GLB/KTX2/world outputs from schemas 12–24; retain only source/configuration/output-verified scripts/archive ingestion. Exact producer 25 required for staged meshes/textures; encoder mode and GPU quality participate in configuration identity. Runtime/launcher accept complete converter schemas 15–25 and world schemas 3–7. Schema 5 grass worlds need no LOD tables.
- V12: Scene-only glTF loads ! reach and retain recursively loaded state after unused subassets release. Native material override retains stock hook's recorded source dependency; scene cloning preserves source and native handles. Probe ! no root-glTF or explicit material loads that mask dependency lifetime failures.

- V13: Converted tangent-space NIF normals ! DirectX Y convention exactly once at native material construction; generic glTF/model-space maps unchanged. Preserve linear RGB & source alpha. ±X/±Y/asymmetric GPU swatches ! match independent geometric normals ≤2/255; legacy no-flip control ! fail.
- V14: NiAlphaProperty owns test/blend enable; vertex-alpha/premultiplied/screendoor flags alone ! opaque. Preserve shader-enabled vertex alpha except native tree/LOD exclusions; prepass & shadow ! same discard as color pass.
- V15: Source UV offset/scale & four S/T clamp modes ! survive conversion. Conflicting wrap or transfer uses ! distinct asset paths; load order cannot change sampler. Alias source mapping ! cache/pruning/restoration consistency.
- V16: Declared EditorMarker & unsupported Fire_Refraction ! excluded with reason; ordinary visible controls remain. Unsupported shader features ! explicit compatibility inventory, no silent parity claim.

## Supported response and remaining material work

| Family / path | Current representation | L1 acceptance status |
|---|---|---|
| Ordinary lighting / opaque | glTF `StandardMaterial`, PBR lighting | Output consistency can be tested now; Specular enable, tangent mask and roughness corrected by T8; native BRDF/model-space parity remains open. Static emission corrected by T6. |
| Alpha-tested / blended | NiAlphaProperty mode, shader-enabled vertex channels, PR #99 prepass | Synthetic color/depth/shadow silhouettes verified; additive and other nonstandard blend factors still approximated. |
| Tangent-space normal maps | Linear RGB/alpha; native material applies DirectX Y convention once | Asymmetric mesh directions match geometric-normal references; NIF authored tangents still regenerated. Terrain owns a separate tangent frame and needs separate native-direction evidence. |
| Model-space normals | No established compatibility path in this slice | Named L1 gap; generic tangent interpretation cannot count as acceptance. |
| Environment-map / parallax / skin / hair / other NIF lighting variants | Raw source contract/extras plus generic approximation | [Compatibility inventory](../../lighting-l1-compatibility.md) names per-family gaps; retained metadata alone is not shader support. |
| Effect shader surfaces | Generic approximation with explicit exclusions | Declared EditorMarker and Fire_Refraction excluded with reasons; no general effect, refraction, particle or animation parity claim. |
| Water / sky | Custom Bevy shader paths | Output-domain test only; authored behavior and full-scene parity remain open. |

## Verification

- `cargo test -p engine --lib`: explicit scene settings, production reflection format, reflection exposure lifecycle, existing renderer/sky regressions.
- `cargo run -p engine --example color_pipeline_probe -- --output <dir> [--interior] [--gray]`: real GPU shader path and pixel comparison; uses headless GPU readback and requires a Vulkan adapter with at least 32 sampled-texture and sampler slots. The probe requests WebGPU features with terrain limits explicitly raised; it does not benchmark the full production device feature set. Software Vulkan is sufficient for functional validation, not performance acceptance.
- Run all four combinations: exterior/interior × gray/HDR. Each writes `probe.png` and `probe.json`. The probe fixes 800×600, orthographic camera `(0,0,10)`, EV100 9.7, TonyMcMapface, no dither/MSAA, full diagnostic fog on one swatch, unit reflectivity on water, and constant sky rows. All are isolated diagnostic settings, not shipping values.
- The probe uses the production reflection allocation and camera setup; its unlit source geometry, render layer and visibility are diagnostic. A clear-only reflection would not exercise material tone mapping. The HDR case includes blue = 2.0 to detect clipping and duplicate display transforms.
- `--legacy-output` is a negative control: restore the previous non-HDR cameras and 8-bit reflection target inside the probe. It must fail the consistency check, with a nonzero status and saved pixel differences. This option does not exist on the game CLI.
- Complete L1 acceptance additionally needs NIF-to-runtime material probes, integrated dependency fixes and matched vanilla neutral/material captures from L0. Leave #131 open until those gates pass.

## Static emission publication (historical schema-17 slice)

Historical packages and probes retain their original producer identities. Current producer 25 regeneration and compatibility are recorded in V11.

[Emission issue #82](https://github.com/Mudcrab-Team/mudcrab/issues/82): `Own_Emit` declares own emittance; `Glow_Map` declares third-slot glow (`vendor/project-wormhole-nif/src/nif_flags.rs`). Glow shader type also permits slot 2. Own_Emit alone retains slot 2 as unclassified source data; no emissive texture sampling.

Publication: `peak = max(1, max(emissive_color))`; `emissiveFactor = max(0, emissive_color) / peak`; `emissiveStrength = max(0, emissive_multiple) * peak`. glTF factor remains in [0,1]; reconstructed linear RGB retains nonnegative authored energy. Extension emitted whenever strength ≠ 1, including 0 and values below 1. Black tint stays black with glow present. Bevy 0.19 glTF loader multiplies factor by strength into `StandardMaterial.emissive`; glow uses sRGB decode once, alpha does not scale opaque emission. No camera/ambient compensation.

Signed NIF tints remain valid. Negative channels retain previous glTF lower-clamp approximation; raw color/multiplier retained under `extras.openSkyrim.sourceEmission`, with explicit representation label. Signed-emission shader behavior remains unsupported; this projection does not claim Skyrim parity. Strength overflow → contextual conversion error. Source contract retains original valid values. Static lighting multipliers retain their raw sign in the contract and `sourceEmission`, including with nonnegative/black tint; only the glTF projection clamps negative values to zero. These are static shader-property values, not proven controller endpoints. NaN/±infinity rejected before publication; animation and shader-family compatibility remain L1 gaps. Contributor reference inspected at `BimingtonBill/mudcrab:ff96ac2b91bec0765d9ce59b2890449923f9d3ed`; emission publisher there retains old defects, so this slice uses current material owner directly.

`material_emission_probe --output <dir> [--interior] [--legacy-emission]`: converter-published synthetic NIF contracts → glTF/KTX2 → Bevy loader → GPU swatches. Nine cases: zero, dim, unit, HDR, dim HDR, black glow, untextured HDR, Own_Emit atlas, signed tint. Loaded factors checked against authored energy; glow view ! `Rgba8UnormSrgb`. Converted swatches compared with independently computed material RGB at tolerance 2/255; zero cases ! black, other references ! visible. 800×900, orthographic camera `(0,0,10)`, no lights/ambient/fog/dither/MSAA, pinned scene tone map/exposure. Interior/exterior here change diagnostic background only; no authored scene parity claim. Synthetic contract publication ≠ full NIF-file parse coverage. `--legacy-emission` restores old energy/eligibility defects inside probe and ! fail with exit 1. Every run records PNG, JSON, generated glTF/KTX2; removes stale verdicts before startup.

Historical emission migration (schema 17): schemas 12–16 retain verified non-GLB entries/archive ingestion only when source and original configuration hash match; GLBs/world data rebuilt. Configuration changes still invalidate cache. Stage journal schema check rejects old staged GLBs. Current runtime/launcher accept complete converter schemas 15–25 and world database schemas 3–7; cell-cache version unchanged.

For testing, reconvert to separate output directory with converter built from this branch, then run matching engine against that directory. Existing packs remain valid in engine but retain old emission until reconverted. Preserve old pack for rollback; older #137 engine rejects schema 17, so use new engine for new pack. Retail reconversion ! isolated matching package; delivery evidence recorded after successful conversion/startup.

Verification: `v6_emission_preserves_zero_dim_hdr_and_black_glow_energy`, `v6_own_emit_does_not_enable_slot_two_glow`, `v6_rejects_overflowing_emission_with_context`, `v8_signed_tint_keeps_source_and_clamps_only_gltf_negative_channels`, `recent_schema_migrations_reuse_only_unchanged_asset_kinds`, `v15_old_material_schemas_rebuild_meshes_and_reuse_compatible_assets`; engine runtime-schema acceptance tests; both probe backgrounds plus legacy negative control. Full converter/engine library suites, formatting and Clippy required before publication.

## Local verification, 2026-10-02

Headless Vulkan on llvmpipe / Mesa 26.2.2, LLVM 21.1.8. No renderer errors in the six final runs. These are functional shader checks, not target-hardware performance or Skyrim visual acceptance.

| Case | Largest channel difference (8-bit) | Expected verdict |
|---|---:|---|
| Exterior, HDR `(0.18, 0.4, 2.0)` | 1 | Pass |
| Interior, HDR | 1 | Pass |
| Exterior, gray `(0.18, 0.18, 0.18)` | 0 | Pass |
| Interior, gray | 0 | Pass |
| Previous output path, HDR | 39 | Fail (negative control) |
| Previous output path, gray | 3 | Fail (negative control) |

HDR mesh/sky/fog/water samples: `(114,151,239)`; terrain: `(114,152,239)`. Previous-path sky: `(118,170,255)`; water: `(107,136,200)`. All new-path gray samples: `(115,115,115)`. Interior background: black. Pixel tolerance was fixed at 2/255 before running; the negative controls returned exit code 1.

Static emission probe: exterior and interior both pass with maximum difference 1/255; all eight loaded material checks pass. Legacy negative control returns exit 1, maximum error 230/255, seven loaded-energy/eligibility checks fail. Zero/black/Own_Emit cases render `(0,0,0)`; dim `(68,21,73)`, unit `(123,49,130)`, textured HDR `(237,145,203)`. 353 converter tests pass (13 existing ignores); 230 engine library tests pass; formatting and converter/engine Clippy libraries/tests/examples pass with warnings denied. Same llvmpipe adapter as above. Evidence: `/home/dev/Projects/mudcrab-lighting-emission-evidence/{exterior,interior,legacy}`; functional synthetic proof, not Fiji performance or vanilla retail acceptance.

Signed-tint correction: 18 failing retail NIFs → 18 converted, zero skips; isolated private-fixture run. Nine-case exterior/interior GPU probes pass ≤1/255; raw signed metadata and nonnegative glTF projection checked. Full converter suite: 354 passed, 13 existing ignores; formatting and Clippy pass. Delivery/full-pack integration passed; T7 complete.

## Fiji delivery, 2026-10-02

Package: `/home/taylor/mudcrab-pr139-8db2a3d`; binaries ! commit `8db2a3d3ef07ef6dd92ad19f0c30d0c4c065da2e` (later documentation-only commits do not change deployed binaries). Separate schema-17 pack: complete; 18 converted, 257849 cache hits, zero skipped; inputs DDS 35663 / NIF 25388 / PEX 15162. World schema 4 integration passes; missing/invalid models 0. Converter quick check passes: 76213 files, 13.1 GB. Package hashes and bundled runtime dependency resolution pass.

RX 6700 XT / RADV NAVI22 / Mesa 26.2.2: nine-case exterior/interior probes both pass, maximum difference 0/255. Legacy control fails with exit 1, maximum error 231/255. Exact packaged `run-riverwood.sh --headless` exits 0 and records `Mudcrab runtime initialized`. Existing #137 package and original schema-16 asset pack preserved; original manifest/database/cell-cache hashes unchanged.

Evidence: package `DEPLOYMENT.json`, `conversion-report.json`, `material-probe/{exterior,interior,legacy}/probe.json`, `asset-check.log`, `smoke-new-assets.log`; local copies under `/home/dev/Projects/mudcrab-lighting-emission-evidence/signed-fix/`. Installed source NIFs stay private. Synthetic GPU/startup proof ≠ matched Skyrim scene acceptance or release performance; L0 comparison and remaining L1 families remain open.

## Specular integration plan

Sources: Bill's `5a116e79c1bc6327b4bd6bdf0c65635464701236` (exponent mapping) & `92d60dc64bcfa0cb210ec0fe4349668ec7c0ce97` (normal-alpha mask/pruning). Adapt owners; do not copy unrelated fork changes. NIF Specular bit 0 and Model_Space_Normals bit 12 traced in vendored flag definitions. Bevy 0.19 glTF loader scales factor by 0.5; fragment multiplies reflectance by mask alpha × 0.5; F0 ! `0.16 * reflectance^2`. Scalar/native response remains declared approximation.

Review: fork factor doubling exceeds glTF domain → reject; native glTF extension handler owns compensation. Tagged masks ! private `/nif` material label & scene binding; no duplicate standard label. Missing/pruned mask ! no compensation. Independent converter publication/pruning tests + runtime loader/GPU comparisons ! pass; legacy behavior ! fail. Gate: GO with V9–V11. No unrelated prepass/sampler integration in this slice.

cmd: `material_specular_probe --output <dir> [--interior] [--legacy-specular]` → PNG/JSON, deterministic paired PBR samples, nonzero failure. Existing camera/exposure settings unchanged; no retail parity claim. Converter marker: `extras.openSkyrim.specularMask = "normal_alpha"`; native handler consumes only marker and actual loaded mask. Native factor compensation ! 2× only at material construction; reloads do not compound.

## Specular local verification, 2026-10-03

358 converter tests pass (13 existing ignores); 231 engine library tests pass; formatting and converter/engine Clippy libraries/tests/examples pass with warnings denied. Nine-case exterior/interior `material_specular_probe`: loaded scene bindings, native factors and shared linear textures pass; maximum paired difference 0/255 on Vulkan llvmpipe / Mesa 26.2.2. Legacy control ! exit 1; maximum difference 248/255. Cases: disabled flag, zero strength, unmasked, full/thatch/zero mask, exponents 100/200, dim strength. Emission regression probe passes ≤1/255.

Evidence: `/home/dev/Projects/mudcrab-lighting-specular-evidence/{exterior,interior,legacy,emission-regression}`. Probe holds camera/exposure/tone map, directional illuminance 5000, zero ambient and no shadows; background varies only exterior/interior. Both native scene binding and independently computed scalar-response references exercised. Retail roof appearance and full-pack delivery remain separate gates; no Skyrim BRDF/parity claim.

## Specular target-hardware verification, 2026-10-03

Full Fiji schema-18 reconversion: 25388 NIFs converted, 232479 cache hits, zero skipped; inputs DDS 35663 / NIF 25388 / PEX 15162. Schema-4 integration passes with missing/invalid models 0; quick asset check passes (76213 files, 13.1 GB). Original schema-16 and prior #139 manifest/database/cell-cache hashes unchanged. Farmhouse audit: 24 thatch materials; `farmlonghouse01.glb` material 1 roughness 0.20 → 0.395188; normal-alpha mask now shares normal texture index 3.

Initial engine ! 224 pending Riverwood instances, no screenshot. Retained source-material dependency fixes scene readiness: 0 pending, 0 load/material validation failures, screenshot captured. Small synthetic fixtures passed even without retention; full Riverwood run supplies failing-first lifetime evidence. `v12_scene_cloning_retains_source_and_native_material_handles` checks reflected scene cloning; probe loads only Scene0, includes inverted-scale variant, and checks recursive readiness again after 90 rendered frames. Engine library 232 passed; updated Clippy/formatting/build pass.

RX 6700 XT / RADV NAVI22 / Mesa 26.2.2: final exterior/interior probes pass, paired difference 0/255; legacy specular control exits 1 with difference 248/255. Matched Riverwood captures: 2540×1375; camera `(2048,1176,452)`, target `(2048,-24,-2048)`, worldspace 60, grid (5,-12), stream radius 2, EV100 9.7, TonyMcMapface. Foreground thatch ROI `[110,785,430,1000]`: encoded-RGB display brightness 161.15 → 140.64 (12.73% decrease). Right thatch `[2090,632,2230,770]`: 120.00 → 112.05 (6.63%). Stable terrain control: mean channel difference 0.154/255; 94.92% pixels identical. Geometry/camera alignment inspected; animated water excluded.

Evidence: `/home/dev/Projects/mudcrab-lighting-specular-evidence/riverwood-comparison/{before-matched.png,after-candidate.png,roof-comparison.png,metrics.json}`, `roof-material-audit.json`, final scene-only probe JSON. Before/after compare #139 versus #141 Mudcrab; blue wash, remaining lighting work, native BRDF/model-space gaps remain. Test-profile 20-second smoke benchmarks pass their configured gates; no release performance or vanilla Skyrim parity acceptance.

## Source material completion (historical schema 19; current producer 25)

`NifMaterialPlugin` extends existing native glTF hook: retain source dependency,
apply tagged normal Y once, preserve mask compensation, apply common native UV
transform even without diffuse. Generic glTF remains unchanged. Alias identity
includes transfer space and S/T clamp mode so shared image loads cannot overwrite
another material's sampler. UV transform remains per material. Historical schema 19 rebuilt GLBs and reused
then-compatible nonmesh outputs. Current producer 25 rebuilds legacy meshes and
textures, including schemas 23 and 24, and retains only verified scripts/archive ingestion.

Riverwood gate source basis: packed NIF tangent follows texture V; split tangent
components follow U. Bevy-generated tangents negate Mikk handedness. Native shader
samples `2 * rgb - 1` in source frame. Converted mesh frame therefore requires
`flip_normal_map_y`; no pixel rewrite, sun reversal or ambient adjustment.
Community Shaders source revision `2f2919a71bed6132b125e41781304c8f6f73d002`,
[`Lighting.hlsl`](https://github.com/doodlum/skyrim-community-shaders/blob/2f2919a71bed6132b125e41781304c8f6f73d002/package/Shaders/Lighting.hlsl),
TBN construction, `TransformNormal`, vertex color and tree/LOD alpha branches.
Direct retail shader/oracle acceptance remains L0-dependent.

`material_normal_probe`: six asymmetric linear DDS normal swatches → converter
material publication → KTX2/glTF → production scene-only native loading → rendered
comparison with geometric normals. Interior/exterior ≤2/255, source alpha preserved,
inverted-scale variant, scene lifetime, all four wrap modes and no-diffuse UV transforms checked. `--legacy-normal` ! fail.
`material_alpha_probe`: fading quad vs explicit half-quad geometry; discarded and
visible color, depth, cast shadow and lit receiver samples. Both backgrounds
≤2/255; `--legacy-prepass` ! fail. Interior diagnostic background ≠ authored
interior lighting verification.

Local llvmpipe Mesa 26.2.2: normal six cases and alpha five cases both backgrounds
match exactly (0/255). Negative controls fail: normal max 61/255, prepass max
154/255. Unit regressions cover modern NIF RGBA through GLB accessors, source
channel matrix, NiAlphaProperty modes, UV/wrap identity, alias pruning/restoration,
cache migration, and exclusion positive/negative controls.

## Historical Fiji GPU verification, 2026-10-03

RX 6700 XT, RADV, Mesa 26.2.2. Both diagnostic backgrounds: normal, alpha,
specular and emission maximum error 0/255; composition maximum 1/255. All ten
positive runs pass. Legacy controls fail with exit 1: normal 61/255, alpha
154/255, specular 248/255, emission 231/255, composition 39/255.
Recorded settings, loader assertions, samples and verdicts:
[`lighting-l1-20261003.json`](../../evidence/lighting-l1-20261003.json).
Synthetic [normal](../../images/l1-normal-comparison.png) and
[alpha](../../images/l1-alpha-comparison.png) comparisons contain no retail assets.

Final workspace verification: 844 passed, 0 failed, 18 existing ignores across
`cargo test --workspace --all-targets` plus `cargo test --workspace --doc`.
Strict workspace Clippy and formatting pass. Independent [CI run 37094801783](https://github.com/Mudcrab-Team/mudcrab/actions/runs/37094801783) passes format, Clippy, tests, security and performance for source commit `dbf048e`. Added sampler/UV assertions in normal
probe subsequently pass targeted Clippy/build and local/Fiji GPU runs.

## Historical L1 delivery, 2026-10-03

[PR #142](https://github.com/Mudcrab-Team/mudcrab/pull/142), source `dbf048e`;
Fiji launcher `/home/taylor/mudcrab-l1-20261003/run-riverwood.sh`.
Optimized test-profile engine/converter and probes, bundled runtime libraries.
Previous #141 pack's manifest/database/cell-cache hashes unchanged.

Schema 19 conversion complete: 25,402 converted, 232,465 cache hits, zero skipped.
25,388 GLBs; 527 absent-source texture references pruned and recorded. World
schema 4 integration passes: missing/invalid models 0, missing textures 0.
Existing source-coverage gaps remain: unavailable model sources 128, unbounded
models 28, unavailable texture sources 16. No claim that conversion creates
content absent from installed Data.

Trusted transferred ingestion/output cache reused with `--no-verify-cache`;
source/configuration checks remain. Post-publication Fiji full size/hash check:
76,213 primary files, 13.5 GB, all pass. Separately verify all 3,998 generated
texture aliases by hard-link identity or source hash; the converter manifest's
primary-file check does not enumerate those aliases. Six differing primary
textures and affected aliases copied privately after the first hash check caught
them. Read-only 1,121,325,056-byte SquashFS stores new meshes/world data inside
package; immutable unchanged textures/scripts share old files by hard link.
Mount helper remounts after reboot and does not pass its mount lock to the daemon.

Matched Fiji captures: six views of three Riverwood gates, before/after exact
1280×800 poses; all settle, none time out. Same engine, camera, exposure and sun;
old schema-18 vs corrected schema-19 material data. Wall normal highlights change
orientation without changing global light direction. Overview checks roofs and
foliage. Retail images stay in private evidence, not the repository.

acceptance and required unsupported material cases. L2 owns remaining hardcoded
sun/ambient/weather behavior. Lighting addons remain out of scope.

## Emission review audit (2026-10-03)

[Aggregate report](../../evidence/lighting-l1-emission-impact-20261003.json): full schema-19
conversion, 25,388 GLBs; 58,133 published lighting-material instances. Parse winning
NIF bytes by manifest source hash (first hash precedes skeleton dependencies), join
source shader block to material extras, compare pre-#139 and corrected publication
on identical inputs. Reconstructed corrected energy matches all 58,133 published
factors/strengths. Effect shaders and excluded shapes outside count; this corpus
includes installed official DLC/Creation Club content, not a base-game-only sample.

- 3,599 instances lose slot-2 glow eligibility; 0 gain it. Eligibility precedes
  missing-texture pruning, so this is not a count of visible glowing surfaces.
- 41 retained glow-eligible instances have black tint; old white fallback removed.
- 4,177 change energy factor; 4,447 change factor or eligibility across 2,512 files.
- 3,631 lose nonzero emission factor; 0 gain it. Texture samples not evaluated.
- No non-finite source emission or strength overflow in counted instances; two
  finite negative static lighting multipliers keep a zero glTF projection.

Malformed emission still fails its asset with source/shape/shader context. Pipeline
records that failure; no successful complete publication with a skipped bad asset.
No clamp of non-finite/overflowing energy introduced: audited data does not justify
one. Finite signed tints and static lighting multipliers retain V8; signed native
emission remains unsupported. Earlier endpoint attribution was unverified. Review regression tests cover non-finite
multipliers before clamping, all non-finite tint channels and invalid negative
effect-material strength. Converter suite: 357 passed, 13 existing ignores; strict Clippy
and formatting pass. L0 acceptance remains open.

Signed-static follow-up: two Volendrung source meshes reconvert successfully in an
isolated mesh-only fixture. Both retain raw multiplier `-0.6013296842575073` and
publish zero glTF strength; 14 absent fixture texture references are pruned and
recorded. This checks source parsing/publication, not rendering or world coverage.
Synthetic regression covers positive, signed and black tint with and without glow.
Existing prereview packs retain their old metadata until rebuilt; use a separate
output or `--invalidate-cache` to refresh it. No new runtime shader behavior or
asset-format version is introduced by this metadata correction.

## Review follow-up (2026-10-03)

Reflection recovery: optional component query restores missing `Exposure` before
rendering; pose/visibility continue. Shared `DEFAULT_SCENE_EV100` owns baseline.
V1 tests execute five world/visual setup systems plus physics fixture startup;
V2 regression fails before fix, then passes with observer exposure and fallback.
232 engine tests pass; strict engine Clippy and formatting pass.

[Existing terrain/water fixture comparison](../../images/l1-color-fixture-comparison.png)
and [capture conditions](../../evidence/lighting-l1-color-fixture-20261003.json):
identical camera, materials, lighting, fixed water time; previous output path vs
HDR/linear reflection. Fixture has no sky; existing composition probe covers sky.
Private capture-only patch uses WebGPU features and 32 texture/sampler limits on
llvmpipe, omits production renderer gate from screenshot readiness. Both runs emit
Xvfb/Vulkan swapchain diagnostics and fail software performance gates. Images are
review evidence, not production-device or retail-parity acceptance. Capture-only
changes reverted; shipping renderer requirements unchanged.
